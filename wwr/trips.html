                    Enjoy a relaxing time kayaking on one of our lakes or smooth flowing river sections. 
                    Some rivers may have class I rapids. All equipment provided. For river trips, return 
                    transportation is also provided. Kayaking trips can be booked for 2, 4, or 6 hours. Bring 
                    sunscreen, water, snacks and a wide brimmed hat is recommended. Lunch can be made available
                    as part of the 4 or 6 hour trips.

                    Our half-day excursions are on areas of the river with class I to class III rapids.
                    Go Pro cameras are available for rental. All other equipment provided and return transportation
                    back to starting location is also provided. Optional lunch can be purchased. This trip is good
                    to explore if you want to make river running a regular part of your outdoor experience. A mid-trip
                    checkpoint is available for those who may want to end their trip early. Minimum age of 10 years old.

                    Our Full-Day Rapids are for the adventuresome individual/group.  Plan to get wet.  Do not bring any 
                    possesions on this excursion that you can not afford to lose in the river. Three optional checkpoints 
                    available are available if needed. These boats need a minimum crew of 8 so if your party is smaller than
                    that you will be combined with other individuals/groups. Lunch provided. Minimum age is 12 years old.
                    All needed equipment provided.

                    which would include camping and hiking excursions on parts of day 2 and/or 3.  All necessary equipment
